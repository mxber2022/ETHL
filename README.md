## Overview
Magic Touch is a lucky draw that is initiated when the football team supported by the whole group wins. 

The outcome of the football game does not impact who is chosen, it is simply the trigger to select the random winner within the friend group.

## MVP Aim
Utilise an oracle to initiate the selection of the random winner within the pool.

## User journey
Group admin creates pool and sets the committment amount by each individual. 
Everyone in the group committs agreed upon amount.
Once (if) their team wins, someone is chosen to receive all the money in the pool.

## Limitations
* No multiple pool creation facilitation
* No commitment control 
* No whitelist
* No fan token pools - only CHZ can be committed 
* Random selection initiated by $CITY fan token price movement
* No reimbursement if selection criteria not achieved
